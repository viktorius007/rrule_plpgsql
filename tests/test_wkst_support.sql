/**
 * Comprehensive WKST (Week Start Day) Support Tests
 *
 * These tests verify that WKST parameter handling works correctly,
 * including all 7 week start values, year boundaries, and BYWEEKNO interactions.
 *
 * Test categories:
 * 1. Basic WEEKLY frequency with different WKST values
 * 2. WEEKLY with BYDAY and different WKST values
 * 3. BYWEEKNO with different WKST values (YEARLY frequency)
 * 4. Year boundary edge cases
 * 5. All 7 WKST values systematically
 * 6. Complex patterns with WKST
 * 7. Edge cases and regression tests
 *
 * Usage:
 *   psql -d your_database -f test_wkst_support.sql
 *
 * Expected output: All tests should pass with "PASS" status
